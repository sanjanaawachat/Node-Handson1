2]Node.js also provides a rich library of various JavaScript modules which simplifies the development of web applications using Node.js to a great extent.

3. what is MiddleWares?

ans: 
1]Middleware is software that provides a bridge between operating systems and the applications that run on them, behaving as a discreet transition layer. So, middleware acts as the “middleman,” facilitating communication, bridging the gaps between tools, databases, and applications, and ultimately providing unified services to end-users.

2]Middleware is also known as “plumbing” since it connects two applications so they can pass data back and forth like through a pipeline. It’s especially useful for organizations that employ containerized or multi-cloud environments.


//TYPES OF MIDDLEWARES:--------------
1] Global Middlewares(all routes is accessed)
2] Local Middlewares(Specific route)

4.What Are Modules in nodeJS?

Modules are the building blocks of an application.
-Modules are isolated pieces of code that when put together construct the larger functioning application.
-The main idea of modules is to break down large pieces of code into smaller pieces. 
-So by storing relevant code in individual files, code can be plugged into other portions of an application via importing. 
-Importing a file means loading in code that is made available for use within the file.
-There are 3 types of modules:
1. Core modules.
2. Local modules.
3. Third-party modules.
